`domain-driven-kit` is an open-source scaffolding project based on Java, designed to help developers quickly build layered applications based on DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles.

## Key Features:

*   A standard DDD layered project structure.
*   Pre-configured Spring Boot Starters for easy integration of common components.
*   Examples of best practices in DDD architecture.
*   Aim to simplify the construction and maintenance process of DDD projects.

`domain-driven-kit` is dedicated to lowering the barrier to learning and practicing DDD, allowing developers to focus more on the implementation of business logic.
