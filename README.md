# 🚀 Domain-Driven-Kit: Java-Based DDD Layered Architecture Scaffolding

`domain-driven-kit` 🛠️ is an open-source scaffolding project built with Java, designed to help developers quickly construct layered applications based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. **It focuses on addressing the abstraction and implementation challenges of DDD, providing a standard and reusable architectural pattern to help teams unify their development practices.**

### ✨ Key Features:

*   **🧱 Standard DDD Layered Project Structure:** Based on the classic four-layer architecture (User Interface, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure), providing clear responsibility separation and dependency management.
*   **📦 Pre-configured Spring Boot Starter:** Facilitates the rapid integration of common components, including data access, transaction management, logging, and validation, with default configurations to simplify development setup.
*   **💡 Best Practices DDD Architectural Example:** Offers a user management example showcasing core DDD concepts such as Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Services, and Repositories, helping developers quickly understand and apply DDD principles.
*   **⚡ Rapid Prototyping:** Enables the quick generation of a DDD project skeleton for rapid prototype verification.
*   **🤝 Unified Team Standards:** Provides a standard architectural pattern to help teams unify their development standards.
*   **⚙️ Extensibility:** Allows for custom extensions based on specific business needs.

### 🎯 Project Goals:

*   **🌱 Lower the Barrier to DDD Practice:** Empowering DDD beginners to quickly get started and apply it to real-world projects.
*   **🚀 Increase Development Efficiency:** Reduce repetitive development through pre-configurations and code examples, thus enhancing efficiency.
*   **👨‍💻 Unify Team Standards:** Provide a standardized DDD architecture to help teams establish uniform development practices.

### 🤔 Pain Points Addressed:

*   😫  DDD concepts are abstract and difficult to implement?
*   😵‍💫 Layered architecture is cumbersome and requires extensive configuration?
*   🧐  Finding appropriate DDD practical examples is challenging?
