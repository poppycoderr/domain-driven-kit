# Changelog

All notable changes to Domain Driven Kit are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Versioning

DDK follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the usual 0.x caveat:

- **0.x**: a minor release (`0.1` → `0.2`) may contain breaking changes, and every one is listed under **Breaking** below. Patch releases (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`) never break.
- **1.0 onwards**: breaking changes only in major releases.
- Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` and published as [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/poppycoderr/domain-driven-kit/releases). DDK is not on Maven Central yet; install it locally with [`scripts/ddk.sh`](./scripts/ddk.sh).

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

The first release: the DDD foundation on a Spring Boot 4.1 baseline.

### Added

- Domain model primitives in `com.ddk.core.domain`: `Identifier`, `ValueObject`, `Entity`, `AggregateRoot`, `DomainEvent`, `DomainEventPublisher`, `Specification`, with a framework-free domain package enforced by tests
- `GenericRepository` backed by MyBatis-Plus, with Entity ↔ PO mappers that fail at startup when missing or duplicated, and optimistic locking through `AggregateRoot.version()`
- Starters under a unified `ddk.*` namespace: web, MyBatis, domain events, Redis, two-level cache, named data sources, tracing, Seata and ArchGuard
- `ddk-cache-starter`: Caffeine (L1) + Redis (L2) with cross-instance invalidation, Redis failure fallback, TTL jitter and Micrometer metrics
- `ddk-redis-starter`: a JSON `RedisTemplate` whose deserialization only accepts allow-listed packages
- `ddk-archguard-starter`: three- and four-layer ArchUnit rules plus domain purity rules
- Three- and four-layer Maven archetypes, and the runnable `ddk-example-user` application
- `scripts/ddk.sh` to install DDK locally and generate projects in one command
- Null-safety: every package in `ddk-core`, `ddk-mybatis` and the starters is `@NullMarked` with JSpecify, and NullAway checks it at compile time
- Quality gates in `mvn verify`: Spotless checks and per-module JaCoCo minimums (70% lines, 50% branches); CI on Java 21 and 25

### Changed

- Baseline is Spring Boot 4.1, Spring Framework 7 and Jackson 3
- `ddk-web-starter` contributes Jackson defaults through `JsonMapperBuilderCustomizer` and serializes `Long` as a string
- `ddk-tracer-starter` builds on `spring-boot-starter-opentelemetry` instead of the whole actuator
- `Entity.id()`, `AggregateRoot.version()` and `ApiResponse` data are declared `@Nullable`; `AbstractException.getArgs()` returns an empty array instead of `null`
- The Redis level of the two-level cache writes synchronously, because Spring Data Redis 4 writes asynchronously by default and that let stale values flow back into L1

### Removed

- `RedisUtil`; inject `RedisTemplate<String, Object>` directly
- The springdoc dependency from `ddk-web-starter`; add it in the application when API docs are needed
